As we're about to add support for GIR build under gtk/dir with
requires it to have its own Makefile.am, use SUBDIRS instead of
include for it.

Changing it would cause linkage breakages with Ubuntu, as we need
to install first libzbar, then libgbargtk, and finally any other
stuff that depends on them.

As we're about to add support for GIR build under gtk/dir with
requires it to have its own Makefile.am, use SUBDIRS instead of
include for it.

Changing it would cause linkage breakages with Ubuntu, as we need
to install first libzbar, then libgbargtk, and finally any other
stuff that depends on them.

Changes:

Thu.    April 1, 2010.  guy@alum.mit.edu.
Summary for 1.1.1 libpcap release
        Update CHANGES to reflect more of the changes in 1.1.0.
        Fix build on RHEL5.
        Fix shared library build on AIX.

Thu.    March 11, 2010.  ken@netfunctional.ca/guy@alum.mit.edu.
Summary for 1.1.0 libpcap release
        Add SocketCAN capture support
        Add Myricom SNF API support
        Update Endace DAG and ERF support
        Add support for shared libraries on Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX
        Build, install, and un-install shared libraries by default;
          don't build/install shared libraries on platforms we don't support
        Fix building from a directory other than the source directory
        Fix compiler warnings and builds on some platforms
        Update config.guess and config.sub
        Support monitor mode on mac80211 devices on Linux
        Fix USB memory-mapped capturing on Linux; it requires a new DLT_
          value
        On Linux, scan /sys/class/net for devices if we have it; scan
          it, or /proc/net/dev if we don't have /sys/class/net, even if
          we have getifaddrs(), as it'll find interfaces with no
          addresses
        Add limited support for reading pcap-ng files
        Fix BPF driver-loading error handling on AIX
        Support getting the full-length interface description on FreeBSD
        In the lexical analyzer, free up any addrinfo structure we got back
          from getaddrinfo().
        Add support for BPF and libdlpi in OpenSolaris (and SXCE)
        Hyphenate ""link-layer"" everywhere
        Add /sys/kernel/debug/usb/usbmon to the list of usbmon locations
        In pcap_read_linux_mmap(), if there are no frames available, call
          poll() even if we're in non-blocking mode, so we pick up
          errors, and check for the errors in question.
        Note that poll() works on BPF devices is Snow Leopard
        If an ENXIO or ENETDOWN is received, it may mean the device has
          gone away.  Deal with it.
        For BPF, raise the default capture buffer size to from 32k to 512k
        Support ps_ifdrop on Linux
        Added a bunch of #ifdef directives to make wpcap.dll (WinPcap) compile
         under cygwin.
        Changes to Linux mmapped captures.
        Fix bug where create_ring would fail for particular snaplen and
          buffer size combinations
        Update pcap-config so that it handles libpcap requiring
          additional libraries
        Add workaround for threadsafeness on Windows
        Add missing mapping for DLT_ENC <-> LINKTYPE_ENC
        DLT: Add DLT_CAN_SOCKETCAN
        DLT: Add Solaris ipnet
        Don't check for DLT_IPNET if it's not defined
        Add link-layer types for Fibre Channel FC-2
        Add link-layer types for Wireless HART
        Add link-layer types for AOS
        Add link-layer types for DECT
        Autoconf fixes (AIX, HP-UX, OSF/1, Tru64 cleanups)
        Install headers unconditionally, and include vlan.h/bluetooth.h if
          enabled
        Autoconf fixes+cleanup
        Support enabling/disabling bluetooth (--{en,dis}able-bluetooth)
        Support disabling SITA support (--without-sita)
        Return -1 on failure to create packet ring (if supported but
          creation failed)
        Fix handling of 'any' device, so that it can be opened, and no longer
          attempt to open it in Monitor mode
        Add support for snapshot length for USB Memory-Mapped Interface
        Fix configure and build on recent Linux kernels
        Fix memory-mapped Linux capture to support pcap_next() and
          pcap_next_ex()
        Fixes for Linux USB capture

Changes:

Thu.    April 1, 2010.  guy@alum.mit.edu.
Summary for 1.1.1 libpcap release
        Update CHANGES to reflect more of the changes in 1.1.0.
        Fix build on RHEL5.
        Fix shared library build on AIX.

Thu.    March 11, 2010.  ken@netfunctional.ca/guy@alum.mit.edu.
Summary for 1.1.0 libpcap release
        Add SocketCAN capture support
        Add Myricom SNF API support
        Update Endace DAG and ERF support
        Add support for shared libraries on Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX
        Build, install, and un-install shared libraries by default;
          don't build/install shared libraries on platforms we don't support
        Fix building from a directory other than the source directory
        Fix compiler warnings and builds on some platforms
        Update config.guess and config.sub
        Support monitor mode on mac80211 devices on Linux
        Fix USB memory-mapped capturing on Linux; it requires a new DLT_
          value
        On Linux, scan /sys/class/net for devices if we have it; scan
          it, or /proc/net/dev if we don't have /sys/class/net, even if
          we have getifaddrs(), as it'll find interfaces with no
          addresses
        Add limited support for reading pcap-ng files
        Fix BPF driver-loading error handling on AIX
        Support getting the full-length interface description on FreeBSD
        In the lexical analyzer, free up any addrinfo structure we got back
          from getaddrinfo().
        Add support for BPF and libdlpi in OpenSolaris (and SXCE)
        Hyphenate ""link-layer"" everywhere
        Add /sys/kernel/debug/usb/usbmon to the list of usbmon locations
        In pcap_read_linux_mmap(), if there are no frames available, call
          poll() even if we're in non-blocking mode, so we pick up
          errors, and check for the errors in question.
        Note that poll() works on BPF devices is Snow Leopard
        If an ENXIO or ENETDOWN is received, it may mean the device has
          gone away.  Deal with it.
        For BPF, raise the default capture buffer size to from 32k to 512k
        Support ps_ifdrop on Linux
        Added a bunch of #ifdef directives to make wpcap.dll (WinPcap) compile
         under cygwin.
        Changes to Linux mmapped captures.
        Fix bug where create_ring would fail for particular snaplen and
          buffer size combinations
        Update pcap-config so that it handles libpcap requiring
          additional libraries
        Add workaround for threadsafeness on Windows
        Add missing mapping for DLT_ENC <-> LINKTYPE_ENC
        DLT: Add DLT_CAN_SOCKETCAN
        DLT: Add Solaris ipnet
        Don't check for DLT_IPNET if it's not defined

        Add link-layer types for Wireless HART
        Add link-layer types for AOS
        Add link-layer types for DECT
        Autoconf fixes (AIX, HP-UX, OSF/1, Tru64 cleanups)
        Install headers unconditionally, and include vlan.h/bluetooth.h if
          enabled
        Autoconf fixes+cleanup
        Support enabling/disabling bluetooth (--{en,dis}able-bluetooth)
        Support disabling SITA support (--without-sita)
        Return -1 on failure to create packet ring (if supported but
          creation failed)
        Fix handling of 'any' device, so that it can be opened, and no longer
          attempt to open it in Monitor mode
        Add support for snapshot length for USB Memory-Mapped Interface
        Fix configure and build on recent Linux kernels
        Fix memory-mapped Linux capture to support pcap_next() and
          pcap_next_ex()

Changes:

Thu.    April 1, 2010.  guy@alum.mit.edu.
Summary for 1.1.1 libpcap release
        Update CHANGES to reflect more of the changes in 1.1.0.
        Fix build on RHEL5.
        Fix shared library build on AIX.

Thu.    March 11, 2010.  ken@netfunctional.ca/guy@alum.mit.edu.
Summary for 1.1.0 libpcap release
        Add SocketCAN capture support
        Add Myricom SNF API support
        Update Endace DAG and ERF support
        Add support for shared libraries on Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX
        Build, install, and un-install shared libraries by default;
          don't build/install shared libraries on platforms we don't support
        Fix building from a directory other than the source directory
        Fix compiler warnings and builds on some platforms
        Update config.guess and config.sub
        Support monitor mode on mac80211 devices on Linux
        Fix USB memory-mapped capturing on Linux; it requires a new DLT_
          value
        On Linux, scan /sys/class/net for devices if we have it; scan
          it, or /proc/net/dev if we don't have /sys/class/net, even if
          we have getifaddrs(), as it'll find interfaces with no
          addresses
        Add limited support for reading pcap-ng files
        Fix BPF driver-loading error handling on AIX
        Support getting the full-length interface description on FreeBSD
        In the lexical analyzer, free up any addrinfo structure we got back
          from getaddrinfo().
        Add support for BPF and libdlpi in OpenSolaris (and SXCE)
        Hyphenate ""link-layer"" everywhere
        Add /sys/kernel/debug/usb/usbmon to the list of usbmon locations
        In pcap_read_linux_mmap(), if there are no frames available, call
          poll() even if we're in non-blocking mode, so we pick up
          errors, and check for the errors in question.
        Note that poll() works on BPF devices is Snow Leopard
        If an ENXIO or ENETDOWN is received, it may mean the device has
          gone away.  Deal with it.
        For BPF, raise the default capture buffer size to from 32k to 512k
        Support ps_ifdrop on Linux
        Added a bunch of #ifdef directives to make wpcap.dll (WinPcap) compile
         under cygwin.
        Changes to Linux mmapped captures.
        Fix bug where create_ring would fail for particular snaplen and
          buffer size combinations
        Update pcap-config so that it handles libpcap requiring
          additional libraries
        Add workaround for threadsafeness on Windows
        Add missing mapping for DLT_ENC <-> LINKTYPE_ENC
        DLT: Add DLT_CAN_SOCKETCAN
        DLT: Add Solaris ipnet
        Don't check for DLT_IPNET if it's not defined
        Add link-layer types for Fibre Channel FC-2
        Add link-layer types for Wireless HART
        Add link-layer types for AOS
        Add link-layer types for DECT
        Autoconf fixes (AIX, HP-UX, OSF/1, Tru64 cleanups)
        Install headers unconditionally, and include vlan.h/bluetooth.h if
          enabled
        Autoconf fixes+cleanup
        Support enabling/disabling bluetooth (--{en,dis}able-bluetooth)
        Support disabling SITA support (--without-sita)
        Return -1 on failure to create packet ring (if supported but
          creation failed)
        Fix handling of 'any' device, so that it can be opened, and no longer
          attempt to open it in Monitor mode
        Add support for snapshot length for USB Memory-Mapped Interface
        Fix configure and build on recent Linux kernels
        Fix memory-mapped Linux capture to support pcap_next() and
          pcap_next_ex()
        Fixes for Linux USB capture

https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_net/pull/48

* Add CMake support.

Implementation is based off SDL2_Image.

* Add CMake tests to test-versioning.sh.

* Add CMake workflow

Changes link flags to fix mingw builds.

`showinterfaces` is disabled on MSVC workflow as the minimum version of SDL is too old for current MSVCRT and gives linker errors even when linking `legacy_stdio_definitions.lib`

* Apply suggestion from review

Only set `Compatible Interface Properties` for shared libraries.

Co-authored-by: Anonymous Maarten <madebr@users.noreply.github.com>

* CMake: Define SDL_MAIN_HANDLED for showinterfaces.

This removes the need for SDL2main as it is a console-only application.
MSVC workflow now builds showinterfaces.

* Apply suggestion from review.

The `mingw32` library is no longer needed as `showinterfaces` is a console app.

Co-authored-by: Anonymous Maarten <madebr@users.noreply.github.com>

* CMake: Update MSVC compiler flags.

Applied review suggestion to use `target_compile_options`.
Replaced `/wd4996` as `_WINSOCK_DEPRECATED_NO_WARNINGS` is enough.
Raise the warning level to `/W3` to be consistent with the solution in
`VisualC/`.

* Apply suggestions from code review.

- Set a different output name for static libraries on MSVC and WATCOM (cf. libsdl-org/SDL_image#275 and libsdl-org/SDL#5727)
- Fix `PKG_PREFIX` on Windows (cf. libsdl-org/SDL_image#274)

* CMake: Generate cmake config when using autotools.

* CMake: Add config files for mingw devel archive.

* CMake: Add config files for VC devel archive.

* Regenerate autotools file with CMake support.

Recent Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 15.10) ship with the updated
version of libselinux. This change makes the SELinux runtime compatible
with the newer versions of the library by replacing security_context_t
with its original char * definition and defining it as const only if the
installed library does so. Whether the system uses const char * types is
detected with the configure script.

This is based off intial work by @jirislaby in #481. However it
has been substantially modified.

Notably it includes a separate build sytem to build the runtimes which
is inspired by the old build system. The reason for doing this is
because CMake is not well suited for building the runtime:

* CMake is configured to use the host compiler, not the bitcode
  compiler. These are not the same thing.

* Building the runtime using `add_custom_command()` is flawed
  because we can't automatically get transitive depencies (i.e.
  header file dependencies) unless the CMake generator is makefiles.
  (See `IMPLICIT_DEPENDS` of `add_custom_command()` in CMake).

So for now we have a very simple build system for building the runtimes.
In the future we can replace this with something more sophisticated if
we need it.

Support for all features of the old build system are implemented apart
from recording the git revision and showing it in the output of
`klee --help`.

Another notable change is the CMake build system works much better with
LLVM installs which don't ship with testing tools. The build system
will download the sources for `FileCheck` and `not` tools if the
corresponding binaries aren't available and will build them. However
`lit` (availabe via `pip install lit`) and GTest must already be
installed.

Apart from better support for testing a significant advantage of the
new CMake build system compared to the existing ""Autoconf/Makefile""
build system is that it is **not** coupled to LLVM's build system
(unlike the existing build system). This means that LLVM's
autoconf/Makefiles don't need to be installed somewhere on the system.

Currently all tests pass.

Support has been implemented in TravisCI and the Dockerfile for
building with CMake.

The existing ""Autoconf/Makefile"" build system has been left intact
and so both build systems can coexist for a short while. We should
remove the old build system as soon as possible though because it
creates an unnecessary maintance burden.^^^^312^^^^242",7e75b491d389c15d48a5cfc455ba9442d7c108ed,Dan Liew,daniel.liew@imperial.ac.uk,1478040450,"Implement a CMake based build system for KLEE.

Converted most of top level configure.ac and Makefile.am into CMakeLists.txt.
Added cmake versions of config.h.in, pocl.icd.in, pocl.pc.in.
Most of LLVM & Clang related stuff is in cmake/LLVM.cmake module.

Changes against configure.ac setup:
- remove install-paths.h references (most are unused anyway); replace
  PKG*DIR variables from install-paths.h with defines from config.h
- replace PACKAGE_VERSION with POCL_VERSION
- replace CLFLAGS with KERNEL_CL_FLAGS, and CLANGXX_FLAGS with
  KERNEL_CLANGXX_FLAGS - they seem more fitting and less confusing (with
  LLVM_{CXX,C,CL}FLAGS being values from llvm-config)
- changed TARGET-{LLC,CLANG}-FLAGS into {CELL,TCE}-{LLC,CLANG}-FLAGS
  seems more consistent wrt >1 ocl ""targets""
- removed {TARGET,HOST}_SIZEOF_<type> defines, they all seem unused;
  there is some code using SIZEOF_<type> defines though.

Primary Fixes:
* Add a whole variable optimization -- used in the rare case that nc_get/put_vara covers the whole of a variable and the variable has a single chunk.
* Fix chunking error when stride causes whole chunks to be skipped.
* Fix some memory leaks
* Add test cases
* Add one performance test to nczarr_test/. This uses the timer utils from unit_test: timer_utils.[ch].
* Move ncdumpchunks utility from ncdump to nczarr_test

Misc. Other Changes:
* Make check for aws libraries conditional on --enable-nczarr-s3
* Remove all but one bm tests from nczarr_test until they are working.
* Remove another dependency on HDF5 from supposedly non-HDF5 specific code; specifically hdf5_log_hdf5.
* Make the BAIL2 macro be hdf5 specific and replace elsewhere with an HDF5 independent equivalent.
* Move hdf5cache.c to libsrc4/nc4cache.c because it is used by nczarr.
* Modify unit_tests so that some of them are run even if using Windows.
* Misc. small bug fixes and refactors and memory leaks.
* Rename some conflicting tests for cmake.
* Attempted to make nc_perf work with cmake and failed.^^^^1279^^^^892",d2316f866ceb6f29bfdc39654095b4a8331c273f,Dennis Heimbigner,dmh@ucar.edu,1608176882,"Additional Fixes to NCZarr
